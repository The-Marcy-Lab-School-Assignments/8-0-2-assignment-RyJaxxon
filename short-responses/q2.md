# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer

Environment variables are key-value pairs used to configure apps outside the source code, helpful for storing data like API keys. You access them via process.env, and to load variables from a .env file, you can use the dotenv package by calling
`require('dotenv').config();`
at the start of your code. This separates configuration from code, making it easier to manage different environments.
