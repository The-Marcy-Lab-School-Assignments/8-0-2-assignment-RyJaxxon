# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

Making API Requests from the front end makes it so that our API Key is visible to the user, we can hide it but if we do then we won't be able to deploy our sites! Instead, making the API request in our backend makes it so the key is hidden and the app can be deployed.
